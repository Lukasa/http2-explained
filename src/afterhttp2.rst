After http2
===========

A lot of tough decisions and compromises have been made for http2. With http2
getting deployed there is an established way to upgrade into other protocol
versions that work which lays the foundation for doing more protocol revisions
ahead. It also brings a notion and an infrastructure that can handle multiple
different versions in parallel. Maybe we don't need to phase out the old
entirely when we introduce new?

http2 still has a lot of HTTP 1 "legacy" brought with it into the future
because of the desire to keep it possible to proxy traffic back and forth
between HTTP 1 and http2. Some of that legacy hampers further development and
inventions. Perhaps http3 can drop some of them?

What do you think is still lacking in http?
